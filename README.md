WordPress 3.9 Style Guide
=========================
The intention of this code snippet is to give others a quick and easy style guide for their WordPress site. It's a bit opinionated code and plugin wise, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to share.

To Use:
1. Create a new Post
2. Switch to the Text tab on the editor
3. Paste in the code from the attached text file
4. Hit Preview or Publish and view the post.
5. Change anything you don't agree with (like if you disagree with one of my plug-ins)
6. Style away!
